            <p>In 1812, the sound of muskets and canons filled the air and Canadians answered the call to arms on our battlefields. The strong Canadian spirit prevailed, protecting our lands from invasion and restoring peace with our American neighbours in 1815. Thankfully, this peace has endured on our land for nearly 200 years and this calls for a celebration.<br><br>

              Today, history seems to repeat itself, but the fight seems to have moved from the battlefield into the boardroom. Across the nation we see the boardrooms are increasingly empty and this puts manufacturing plants at risk of being shuttered. In the beer industry, the 3 largest brewing companies have already lost the battle for the boardroom and ever since 2006 even the beer store is under foreign ownership and control for the first time since its founding in 1927.<br><br>

              Today not one of the top 10 brands in Ontario’s beer stores is brewed by a Canadian owned and controlled brewery and I think it’s time for change. Please enjoy the timeline and help our cause by supporting your local brewery.</p></div>

                  <span class="bold">1836:</span> Strathroy Flour Mills started in 1836 when John Buchanan built a grist
                  mill to meet the growing demand of the settlers. Eventually Richard
                  Pincombe bought it in 1862 and this family tradition of flour milling
                  would be continued by three generations of Pincombe.

                  Western Steam Brewery to incorporate the great watchword of the age “steam”.
                  Steam revolutionized how breweries were designed, powered and operated and
                  in Victorian Canada, a steam brewery was on that possess the latest
                  technology – a steam heated kettle. Matthew Bixel purchased the business
                  in 1875 and perceiving the trend toward lager became the first lager brewer
                  in Western Ontario.

                  Nearly all the best houses [taverns and saloons] in the city run it,
                  and Bixel’s Strathroy Lager is becoming quite a household word.” </p>
